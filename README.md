# speccy-bum â€” a javascript Spectrum emulator


### Clone speccy-bum

Clone the angular-seed repository using [git][git]:

```
git clone https://github.com/yosser/speccybum
cd speccybum
```

### Install Dependencies


```
npm install or
npm start

```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`.  You should find that you have two new
folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the angular framework files

*Note that the `bower_components` folder would normally be installed in the root folder but
angular-seed changes this location through the `.bowerrc` file.  Putting it in the app folder makes
it easier to serve the files by a webserver.*

### Run the Application

Install the dependencies and start the server:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8080`.
