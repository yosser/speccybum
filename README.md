# speccy-bum â€” a javascript Spectrum emulator


### Clone speccy-bum

Clone the angular-seed repository using [git][git]:

```
git clone https://github.com/yosser/speccybum
cd speccybum
```

### Install Dependencies


```
npm install
```

Behind the scenes this will also call `bower install`.  You should find that you have two new
folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need
* `app/bower_components` - contains the angular framework files

*Note that the `bower_components` folder would normally be installed in the root folder but
angular-seed changes this location through the `.bowerrc` file.  Putting it in the app folder makes
it easier to serve the files by a webserver.*

### Run the Application

We have preconfigured the project with a simple development web server.  The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
npm start
```

Now browse to the app at `http://localhost:8000/app/index.html`.


```
npm start
```

In addition, since Protractor is built upon WebDriver we need to install this.  The angular-seed
project comes with a predefined script to do this:

```
npm run update-webdriver
```

This will download and install the latest version of the stand-alone WebDriver tool.

Once you have ensured that the development web server hosting our application is up and running
and WebDriver is updated, you can run the end-to-end tests using the supplied npm script:

```
npm run protractor
```

This script will execute the end-to-end tests against the application being hosted on the
development server.


## Updating Angular

Previously we recommended that you merge in changes to angular-seed into your own fork of the project.
Now that the angular framework library code and tools are acquired through package managers (npm and
bower) you can use these tools instead to update the dependencies.

You can update the tool dependencies by running:

```
npm update
```

This will find the latest versions that match the version ranges specified in the `package.json` file.

You can update the Angular dependencies by running:

```
bower update
```

This will find the latest versions that match the version ranges specified in the `bower.json` file.


## Loading Angular Asynchronously

The angular-seed project supports loading the framework and application scripts asynchronously.  The
special `index-async.html` is designed to support this style of loading.  For it to work you must
inject a piece of Angular JavaScript into the HTML page.  The project has a predefined script to help
do this.

```
npm run update-index-async
```

This will copy the contents of the `angular-loader.js` library file into the `index-async.html` page.
You can run this every time you update the version of Angular that you are using.


## Serving the Application Files

While angular is client-side-only technology and it's possible to create angular webapps that
don't require a backend server at all, we recommend serving the project files using a local
webserver during development to avoid issues with security restrictions (sandbox) in browsers. The
sandbox implementation varies between browsers, but quite often prevents things like cookies, xhr,
etc to function properly when an html page is opened via `file://` scheme instead of `http://`.


### Running the App during Development

The angular-seed project comes preconfigured with a local development webserver.  It is a node.js
tool called [http-server][http-server].  You can start this webserver with `npm start` but you may choose to
install the tool globally:

```
sudo npm install -g http-server
```

Then you can start your own development web server to serve static files from a folder by
running:

```
http-server -a localhost -p 8000
```

Alternatively, you can choose to configure your own webserver, such as apache or nginx. Just
configure your server to serve the files under the `app/` directory.


### Running the App in Production

This really depends on how complex your app is and the overall infrastructure of your system, but
the general rule is that all you need in production are all the files under the `app/` directory.
Everything else should be omitted.

Angular apps are really just a bunch of static html, css and js files that just need to be hosted
somewhere they can be accessed by browsers.

If your Angular app is talking to the backend server via xhr or other means, you need to figure
out what is the best way to host the static files to comply with the same origin policy if
applicable. Usually this is done by hosting the files by the backend server or through
reverse-proxying the backend server(s) and webserver(s).


## Continuous Integration

### Travis CI

[Travis CI][travis] is a continuous integration service, which can monitor GitHub for new commits
to your repository and execute scripts such as building the app or running tests. The angular-seed
project contains a Travis configuration file, `.travis.yml`, which will cause Travis to run your
tests when you push to GitHub.

You will need to enable the integration between Travis and GitHub. See the Travis website for more
instruction on how to do this.

### CloudBees

CloudBees have provided a CI/deployment setup:

<a href="https://grandcentral.cloudbees.com/?CB_clickstart=https://raw.github.com/CloudBees-community/angular-js-clickstart/master/clickstart.json">
<img src="https://d3ko533tu1ozfq.cloudfront.net/clickstart/deployInstantly.png"/></a>

If you run this, you will get a cloned version of this repo to start working on in a private git repo,
along with a CI service (in Jenkins) hosted that will run unit and end to end tests in both Firefox and Chrome.
